## 🔴 P0 finding (2026-07-20, still unresolved): PR pile-up is worse, not better

PR #533 (black/isort repo-wide fix) merged 2026-07-18 as recommended, but
**the open-PR count has grown since**: 515 open PRs as of 2026-07-20
(was 494 on 2026-07-18), with still only a handful ever merged. Merging
the CI-blocker fixed *future* PRs' ability to go green, but nothing is
triaging the backlog itself — every automation session (including this
one) keeps opening new small PRs on top of an already-unreviewed pile.

**This needs an owner decision, not another automated PR.** Options
flagged in PR #533 and repeated here: (a) batch rebase + review the
highest-value subset and close the rest as superseded/duplicate, (b)
enable auto-merge for green-CI PRs from this automation so they stop
queuing up for manual review, or (c) explicitly tell the automation to
stop opening new PRs until the backlog is cleared. Until one of these
happens, this nightly loop will keep adding to the pile — flagging this
every run rather than silently continuing.

## 🔴 P0 finding (2026-07-18): CI itself was blocking every merge

As of 2026-07-18 the repo had **494 open PRs and only 8 ever merged**
(last merge: PR #218, 2026-06-01). Root cause: `sc2bot-ci.yml`'s `test`
job depends on `lint`, and `lint` runs `black --check --diff .` /
`isort --check-only --diff .` against the **whole repo**. `main` had
66 files that already failed `black --check`, so `lint` failed on
every PR regardless of content, `test` never ran, and CI could never
go green. Once that was fixed (PR #533), the `test` job ran for the
first time ever and immediately surfaced three more real CI bugs:
wrong test path (`tests/unit` doesn't exist), missing `pytest-timeout`
for the `--timeout=120` flag, `wicked_zerg_challenger/tests/` (661
tests, most of the actual bot-logic coverage) never wired into CI at
all, and a missing `PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python` env
var (needed because `s2clientprotocol`'s generated `_pb2` files predate
the installed protobuf runtime's C++ backend) in **both** `ci.yml` and
`sc2bot-ci.yml`. See PR #533 for the full diff/fix.

**Action needed from the repo owner:** merge PR #533 first, then decide
a policy for the other ~490 open PRs (rebase + re-review in batches,
enable auto-merge on green CI, or close superseded duplicates) — CI
being permanently red is very likely why none of them ever merged.

## Snapshot (current state)

- Branch: `main`, last commit `7d24294` (black+isort repo sweep, PR #533, merged 2026-07-18)
- Bot core: `wicked_zerg_challenger/` — 179+ Python files across 10+ subdirs.
- `.gitattributes` enforces `* text=auto` ✅
- CI: `sc2bot-ci.yml` runs black + isort + flake8 — **fixed in PR #533 (merged 2026-07-18)**
- **Test suite (local verification, 2026-07-20, sandbox without real `sc2`/`burnysc2` installed): `tests/` 428 passed / 20 skipped / 0 failed after fixing the collection-abort bug (PR #558)**
- Queen transfusion logic: 3 bugs fixed (`is_idle` guard removed, target dedup, per-queen cooldown) ✅
- **Open PR backlog: 515 open, ~9 merged total — see P0 finding above, needs owner decision**

## Resolved this run (2026-07-20)

| Item | File(s) | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Suite-wide collection abort without `sc2` installed | `tests/test_queen_transfusion.py` | Only test file missing the `try/except ImportError: pytest.skip(...)` guard every sibling sc2-import test uses. Caused `pytest tests/` to abort collecting **all** 400+ tests (not just this file) in any environment without the `sc2` package. Fixed to match siblings. PR #558 (open). |
| Local sandbox missing dev deps | n/a (environment only) | `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-timeout`, `pytest-mock`, `numpy`, `cffi` were absent in this session's sandbox, causing 83 additional async-test failures + 7 `cryptography`/pyo3 panics + several numpy-gated skips. Installed locally to verify; already correctly pinned in `requirements.txt`/`requirements-dev.txt`, no repo change needed. |
| Post-fix full-suite result | `tests/` | 428 passed, 20 skipped (all remaining skips are legitimate env gaps: sc2 lib, pyupbit, config.yaml). |

**Open PR backlog: 515 open, ~9 ever merged — see P0 finding above.**

## Resolved this run (2026-05-03)

| Item | File(s) | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| pytest-asyncio missing | sandbox install | Installed pytest-asyncio 1.3.0 — cleared 83 "async def not natively supported" failures. Note: add to `requirements-dev.txt`. |
| QMIX torch stubs | `qmix_marl/sc2_qmix_agent.py` | `NameError: nn is not defined` at module level when torch absent. Added `types.SimpleNamespace` stubs in `except ImportError` block. |
| MAPPO torch stubs | `mappo_marl/sc2_mappo_agent.py` | Same fix as QMIX. |
| MAPPO `__init__` stale exports | `mappo_marl/__init__.py` | Imported non-existent names `ActorNetwork, MAPPOAgent, MAPPOTrainer, SharedCritic`. Replaced with correct names + backward-compat aliases. |
| comm_learning `__init__` stale exports | `comm_learning/__init__.py` | Imported non-existent `CommAgent, CommChannel, CommNet, TarMAC`. Fixed with correct names + aliases + `CommChannel` stub class. |
| Gas overflow test stale | `tests/test_phase10_improvements.py` | Test asserted threshold == 1000 but code was intentionally improved to 800. Updated assertion. |
| Crypto test missing skipif | `tests/test_crypto_trading.py` | `test_import_auto_trader` and `test_import_market_analyzer` were guarded by `pandas` check but both transitively require `pyupbit`. Added `pyupbit` to their `skipif` condition. |

**Net result: 90 failures → 0 failures. Suite: 398 pass / 20 skip.**

## P2 — Nice-to-have

## Long-term direction

- **AI Arena submission cadence.** 2-week cadence: benchmark suite (P2.2), submit only if metrics improve.
- **Self-play loop.** `NEXT_LARGE_PLAN.md` P823 — highest-leverage long-term improvement.
- **Macro / micro directory split.** Keep `wicked_zerg_challenger/macro/` vs `wicked_zerg_challenger/micro/`.
