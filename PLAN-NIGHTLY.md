## Snapshot (current state, verified 2026-07-02)

- Branch: `main`, working branch: `claude/optimistic-edison-mtv6ug` (PR #234)
- Bot core: `wicked_zerg_challenger/` — 179+ Python files across 10+ subdirs.
- `.gitattributes` enforces `* text=auto` ✅
- CI: `ci.yml` "SC2 봇 검증 & 테스트" job ✅ passing. `ci.yml` "Python 린트 & 테스트" job was
  failing on every push to `main` due to a missing `PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python`
  env var (fixed in PR #234). `sc2bot-ci.yml` "Lint & Type Check" job is still failing — 65 files
  are not black-formatted repo-wide; this is a pre-existing issue, not caused by this session, and
  is large enough in scope (spans non-bot subsystems too) that it needs a user decision before a
  mass reformat PR.
- **Test suite (verified by actually running pytest, not by reading old docs):**
  `tests/` (repo root) 502 passed / 14 skipped / 0 failed. `wicked_zerg_challenger/tests/` 661
  passed / 0 failed. Prior numbers in this doc (468/15/0) could not be reproduced as-is on a clean
  checkout without first fixing 3 real bugs (see below) — treat historical counts here as
  approximate, not authoritative.
- Found and fixed this session: (1) CI protobuf env gap, (2) `asyncio.get_event_loop()` test-order
  dependency in `test_combat_phase_fsm.py`, (3) 18 `async def test_*` methods on plain
  `unittest.TestCase` in `test_production_resilience.py`/`test_opponent_modeling.py` that were
  never actually awaited/executed (always reported "passed" without running). Fixing (3) surfaced
  3 genuinely stale tests calling an old `_get_counter_unit()` signature, now updated to match.
- Queen transfusion logic: 3 bugs fixed (`is_idle` guard removed, target dedup, per-queen cooldown) ✅
- **Note for future nightly runs:** REMAINING_ISSUES.md previously listed several issues (N1-N4,
  Issue #3, Issue #4) as "open" that were, on inspection, already fixed in code. Always verify
  against the actual source/tests before trusting a doc's "open" status.

## Resolved this run (2026-05-03)

| Item | File(s) | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| pytest-asyncio missing | sandbox install | Installed pytest-asyncio 1.3.0 — cleared 83 "async def not natively supported" failures. Note: add to `requirements-dev.txt`. |
| QMIX torch stubs | `qmix_marl/sc2_qmix_agent.py` | `NameError: nn is not defined` at module level when torch absent. Added `types.SimpleNamespace` stubs in `except ImportError` block. |
| MAPPO torch stubs | `mappo_marl/sc2_mappo_agent.py` | Same fix as QMIX. |
| MAPPO `__init__` stale exports | `mappo_marl/__init__.py` | Imported non-existent names `ActorNetwork, MAPPOAgent, MAPPOTrainer, SharedCritic`. Replaced with correct names + backward-compat aliases. |
| comm_learning `__init__` stale exports | `comm_learning/__init__.py` | Imported non-existent `CommAgent, CommChannel, CommNet, TarMAC`. Fixed with correct names + aliases + `CommChannel` stub class. |
| Gas overflow test stale | `tests/test_phase10_improvements.py` | Test asserted threshold == 1000 but code was intentionally improved to 800. Updated assertion. |
| Crypto test missing skipif | `tests/test_crypto_trading.py` | `test_import_auto_trader` and `test_import_market_analyzer` were guarded by `pandas` check but both transitively require `pyupbit`. Added `pyupbit` to their `skipif` condition. |

**Net result: 90 failures → 0 failures. Suite: 398 pass / 20 skip.**

## P2 — Nice-to-have

| #    | Item                                            | Status | Notes |
|------|-------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| P2.1 | Force-accumulation FSM tests                    | ✅ Done | `tests/test_combat_phase_fsm.py` — 23 tests all passing. |
| P2.2 | Benchmark runner                                | ❌ Open | Single command, N replays, APM/supply/win-rate report vs Hard. |
| P2.3 | Build-order config externalisation              | ❌ Open | Move top-20 hardcoded values to `config/build_orders.yaml`. |
| P2.4 | RL agent save-experience guard                  | ❌ Open | Unit test for save under disk-full / interrupted-rename. |
| P2.5 | Type hints + docstring pass on core modules     | ❌ Open | `core/resource_manager.py`, `core/manager_factory.py`. |

## Long-term direction

- **AI Arena submission cadence.** 2-week cadence: benchmark suite (P2.2), submit only if metrics improve.
- **Self-play loop.** `NEXT_LARGE_PLAN.md` P823 — highest-leverage long-term improvement.
- **Macro / micro directory split.** Keep `wicked_zerg_challenger/macro/` vs `wicked_zerg_challenger/micro/`.

## Run history

- **2026-04-25** — Initial nightly plan.
- **2026-04-26** — P0.2 (empty-logger CI guard) landed.
- **2026-04-27** — black + isort + flake8 all clean.
- **2026-04-28** — Harassment retraction logic hardened (P1.2).
- **2026-05-01** — P1.1 scout cadence, P1.2 harassment, P1.3 expansion timing, P1.5 doc history. Commit blocked by index.lock.
- **2026-05-02** — P0 scout import mismatch fixed. P1.4 deprecation shim. P2.1 FSM tests 23/23 pass.
- **2026-05-03** — **Test suite cleared:** 90 failures → 0. Fixed pytest-asyncio, torch stubs (qmix/mappo), stale __init__ exports (mappo/comm_learning), gas threshold test, crypto skipif guards. Final: 398 pass / 20 skip / 0 fail.
- **2026-07-02** — Re-verified everything against a clean checkout instead of trusting prior doc
  claims. Confirmed N1-N4, Issue #3, Issue #4 in REMAINING_ISSUES.md were already fixed in code
  (docs were stale). Found and fixed 3 real bugs: CI protobuf env gap blocking main CI, an
  event-loop-order test failure in `test_combat_phase_fsm.py`, and 18 async test methods across two
  files that were never actually being awaited/executed by plain `unittest.TestCase` (always
  reported "passed" with zero real assertions run) — fixing that surfaced 3 stale
  `_get_counter_unit()` calls using a removed signature, now updated. Also found `sc2bot-ci.yml`'s
  Lint & Type Check job has been failing on `main` for a long time (65 files not black-formatted,
  repo-wide, unrelated to this session) — flagged for user decision rather than doing a large
  mechanical reformat unprompted. PR: #234.
